conditional checks in bash:

"-eq" -> equals
"-ne" -> not equals
"-gt" -> greater than
"-lt" -> less than
"-ge" -> greater than or equal
"-le" -> less than or equal


"-f" -> for files exists and is a regular file
"command" -> this command checks for the existence of a command (does not need square brackets in if statement)
"which 'command' " -> tells us the fully qualified path to the command
